# GitHub Copilot Spaces—Setup and Maintenance Checklist

## Naming and Purpose
- [ ] Choose a clear, purpose-driven Space title (e.g., "ServiceName—Onboarding Helper"). Stick to one job per Space.
- [ ] Write a 1–2 sentence description outlining the scope, intended audience, and expected outputs.
- [ ] Add a short "How to use this Space" note at the top of the instructions.

## Ownership and Visibility
- [ ] Set the correct owner (individual or organization).
- [ ] Select appropriate Space visibility (private, org-visible, etc.).
- [ ] Verify access with at least one non-owner who should have GitHub permissions.
- [ ] Share Space URL and add collaborators, where available.

## Security and Privacy
- [ ] Avoid pasting sensitive data in free-text; link to version-controlled files instead.
- [ ] Confirm all attached sources are suitable for selected visibility.
- [ ] If uploads are supported, limit text content to what's safe for sharing.
- [ ] Remove obsolete or confidential materials from the Space.

## Discoverability and Documentation
- [ ] Use consistent naming conventions (prefixes or tags for teams/services if possible).
- [ ] Add tags or keywords in the description to help with search/discovery.
- [ ] Announce or catalog the Space in your organization's preferred directory or communication channel.

## Review Cadence and Governance
- [ ] Assign a maintainer/owner accountable for Space updates.
- [ ] Set a regular review cadence (e.g., monthly or per release).
- [ ] During reviews:
  - Validate all links.
  - Test with 2–3 representative prompts.
  - Update examples and prune noisy/outdated sources.
  - Confirm correct visibility and permissions.
- [ ] Track feedback and improvement requests (issues, discussion, or checklist in description).

**Tip:** Copy/paste and adapt this checklist for new Spaces. Review regularly to keep Spaces discoverable, usable, and secure.
